# Fatigue Analysis Using Torque & EMG Data ðŸ’ªðŸ“Š
Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB-based fatigue analysis pipeline designed to assess neuromuscular fatigue using torque and EMG signals. 
The script:
- Automates MVC trials and fatigue contraction analysis
- Computes Central Activation Ratio (CAR) to quantify voluntary activation
- Uses filtered torque signals to extract fatigue progression metrics
- Saves processed data to .csv for further analysis

Features
âœ… Automated subject data import
âœ… Filters torque data for noise reduction
âœ… Computes Central Activation Ratio (CAR) at 50ms & 100ms windows
âœ… User-guided MVC onset & offset selection
âœ… Saves processed results in CSV format
